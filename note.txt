Folder Structure and Description





.next: 
This folder is automatically generated by Next.js and contains build-related files used during development and production. It includes cached assets, pages, server configuration, and more.


node_modules:
This folder is created when you install dependencies using npm. It houses all the packages required for your project.


public: 
This folder is where you place static assets like images, fonts, and other files that don't need to be processed by Next.js.



src: This is the main source code directory where we'll write our application code.
	components: Storage of React components. These components can be reused across different pages or sections of 	the 	app.

	pages: This is where we define our routes and page components. Each JavaScript/TypeScript file in this directory 		becomes a route in your application. For example, index.js becomes the root route ("/"), about.js becomes "/about", 	and so on.

	styles:CSS, SCSS, or other styling files remains here. These styles can be globally applied or scoped to 			specific components.

	utils: If we have utility functions, helper scripts, or constants, we can organize them in this directory.

	layouts:we can create layout components that wrap around our pages. These can contain common UI elements like 			headers, footers, etc.

	api: If we want to create an API route, we can place it in this directory. These routes can be used for server-			side functionality.

	 we can further organize our code into subdirectories based on our project's needs.


.gitignore: 
This file specifies files and directories that should be ignored by version control (Git), such as the "node_modules" folder or sensitive environment files.


package.json: 
This file contains information about your project and its dependencies. You can also define scripts for tasks like starting the development server or building the project.


README.md: 
This is where you can provide documentation for your project, explaining its purpose, how to set it up, and how to use it.



next.config.js: This is a configuration file for Next.js where you can customize various aspects of the build and development process.



jsconfig.json: 
This configuration file is used to specify the options and settings for JavaScript and TypeScript in your project. It's particularly useful for enabling features like absolute imports and custom paths


tailwind.config.js: This file allows you to customize various aspects of your Tailwind CSS setup

postcss.config.js: This file configures the behavior of PostCSS, a tool for transforming styles with JavaScript plugins. It's often used in modern front-end development to handle tasks like autoprefixing, minification, and more.
